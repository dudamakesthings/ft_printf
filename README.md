The printf function needs to work with this conditions:

- `%c` Prints a single character.
- `%s` Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
- `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
- `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
- `%i` Prints an integer in base 10.
- `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
- `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
- `%%` Prints a percent sign.

Used this test to check my project (thanks to the creator!), and my small test into main function ([main.c](https://github.com/dudamakesthings/ft_printf/blob/main/main.c)).
